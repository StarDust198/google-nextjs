## Overview

### The challenge

My goal was to make a website look similar to google on React/NextJS, practice with TypeScript and SSR.

### Links

- Live Site URL - will be available soon: [The future live site URL](https://google.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup, Flexbox, CSS Grid,
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Strongly typed programming language built upon JS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) - Authentication for Next.js
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I've learned to use Google Programmable Search API, to autentificate with NextAuth, to type response wtih TypeScript better.

### Continued development

I'm not planning to develop this project much further, but I can see possibilities of the images page to be made.

### Useful resources
